1. Redux Store

--> console.log(store);

--> As you can see 3 methods are important
1. dispatch
2. subscribe
3. getState

--> State only changes from dispatch method

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Installing Redux DevTools

--> Downlaod Redux DevTools from chrome extensions

--> For this extension to work, you have to pass 2nd argument to createStore method

const store = createStore(
  reducer, 
  window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
);

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. The Basics

--> On upper left tab, it is monitor
--> It displays actions in different forms
--> 1. Log Monitore display as list of action and state
--> 2. Inspector is more nice

--> On right upper tab, it is instance
--> If you have more one project running, then all instance of project show here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Inspector Monitor

--> Left side shows all actions
--> On right side, shows information of selected action, if not selected, display information of last action

--> On right side, there are 5 tabs
1. Action: shows action information/data to modify in state object
2. State : show state of application after that action
3. Diff  : show difference between previous state and after state.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Tracing

--> npm i redux-devtools-extension
--> It tells position in source code, from where your action gets dispatched.

--> few changes in store.js

import { devToolsEnhancer } from 'redux-devtools-extension'
const state = createStore(reducer, devToolsEnhancer({ trace: true }));

--> In webpack.config.js, add this property,
devtool: "source-map"

--> Now open trace tab, show position of selected action method
--> Go to settings in right bottom, choose external location: vscode and give path of project

--> Now when you select in trace action method, it will go to vscode editor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Exporting and Importing

--> It is best for finding bug in application 
--> When any user sees bug in our application, we do not follow all steps to reach that to that bug
--> There is package Log Rocket is used for this.

--> When you are done with all actions
--> Click on download button below in redux dev-tools
--> When user finds a bug, it will recorded in this file
--> So you just open that file by importing in dev-tools and see all corresponding actions.
