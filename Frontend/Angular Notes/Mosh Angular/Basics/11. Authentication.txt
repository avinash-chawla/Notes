1. Architecture

--> Angular sends login credentials to server
--> Server in response sends jwt(json web token) to angular
--> JWT is simple json object which contains information about user
--> This JWT is saved in local storage of browser
--> When client sends some request to server, request is sent with JWT to verify authentication of user(is he admin or guest user)

--> Normally Authentication is done using server database and not with json webtoken.
--> But some Client-side applications like Angular uses this approach to authenticate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. JSON Web Token

--> It is json object only 
--> But while transfering from server to client, it is encoded in base64algorithm
--> This web token consists of 3 parts: Header, Payload and verify signature
--> Header is json object with some standards
--> Payload is json object with user information like Id, name, isAdmin
--> Verify Signature is json object with encryption which has secret_key which is only available at server.
--> This Json web token can be decoded in plain json object using this secret_key


--> Hacker can only access information using secret_key but cannot modify it.
--> Because if he change json object and sent it to server, whole base64algorithm changes which can not be find in server

3. Making Auth API

--> Refer dev ed youtube video to make this on nodejs
