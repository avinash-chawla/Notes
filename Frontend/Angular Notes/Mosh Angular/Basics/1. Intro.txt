1. Why angular if we have vanilla js and jquery
--> it provides clean structure, more testable, utility functions

2. download command line interface from node npm @angular/cli
--> npm install -g @angular/cli
--> this interface will help to generate angular project structure
--> ng --version

3. use this cli to make angular project structure
--> ng new projectName
--> ng serve (start web server)

4. structure-->

e2e (end-to-end tests)
node modules
src (source code)
polyfills 	--> fills gap between js features which are not supported by browsers
karma.conf.js 	--> test runner for javascript code
tsconfig.json	--> settings for compiling typescript code to js
tslint.json 	--> analysis tool for typescript 

5. webpack--->
--> it is a build automation tools.
--> it collects all scripts and stylesheets and bind them in bundle for optimization eg. polyfills, main(src code), styles(css files), vendor(3rd party libraried). and this js bundle is compiled in browser

--> webpack has a feature called (HMR) hot module replacement which means with any change in any of files, it recompiles 

6. angular3 --> only one library angular/routes has included in angular3 while all other in angular2 so directly version 4 with all latest 4.* versions
