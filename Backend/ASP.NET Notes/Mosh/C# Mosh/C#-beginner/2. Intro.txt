1. C# vs .Net

--> C# is a programming language
--> .Net is framework for building windows applications

2. .Net-->

--> it consists of two components--> CLR(Common Language Runtime) and Class Library(dll)
--> CLR = compiler
--> dll = Libraries like System.Data, System.Web, System.Net

3. CLR-->

--> CLR converts IL code (Intermediate Level) to machine code
--> C# compiler converts sourse code to IL code and CLR is an application which converts IL code to machine code
--> CLR is different for different machines and C# is same

4. Architecture of .Net Applications-->

--> class is a container for data and methods
--> namespace is a collection of related classes --> another name library
--> Assembly is a collection of all related namespaces called DLL (dynamically linked library)
--> Application is a collection of all assembly 

5. Hello World-->

--> open VS IDE --> new project --> C# WindowsApplication (Console Application)--> name it DemoProject
--> using statements are importing namespaces, all included in .Net framework

1. System		--> utility functions, primitive data types
2. System.Collections	--> lists, array
3. Linq			--> To query DataModel objects
4. Text 		--> work with text
5. Threading		--> for making multithreading application

--> Main method is starting point of application
--> it accepts array of string called args
--> Console is a class to access to console application
--> Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
--> ctrl+f5 --> to run
