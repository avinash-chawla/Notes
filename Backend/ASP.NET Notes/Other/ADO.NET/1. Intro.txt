1. Intro

--> ADO.NET is a module of .Net Framework which is used to establish connection between application and data sources. 
--> Data sources can be such as SQL Server and XML. ADO.NET consists of classes that can be used to connect, retrieve, insert and delete data.

--> All the ADO.NET classes are located into System.Data.dll and integrated with XML classes located into System.Xml.dll.

--> ADO.NET has two main components that are used for accessing and manipulating data are the .NET Framework data provider and the DataSet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. .NET Framework Data Providers

--> These are the components that are designed for data manipulation and fast access to data. 
--> It provides various objects such as Connection, Command, DataReader and DataAdapter that are used to perform database operations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. The DataSet

--> It is used to access data independently from any data resource. 
--> DataSet contains a collection of one or more DataTable objects of data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Which one should we use DataReader or DataSet?

--> We should consider the following points to use DataSet.

--> It caches data locally at our application, so we can manipulate it.
--> It interacts with data dynamically such as binding to windows forms control.
--> It allows performing processing on data without an open connection. It means it can work while connection is disconnected.
--> If we required some other functionality mentioned above, we can use DataReader to improve performance of our application.

--> DataReader does not perform in disconnected mode. It requires DataReader object to be connected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. ADO.NET Framework Data Providers

--> Data provider is used to connect to the database, execute commands and retrieve the record. 
--> It is lightweight component with better performance. It also allows us to place the data into DataSet to use it further in our application.

--> Following are the core object of Data Providers.


Object		Description

Connection	It is used to establish a connection to a specific data source.
Command		It is used to execute queries to perform database operations.
DataReader	It is used to read data from data source. The DbDataReader is a base class for all DataReader objects.
DataAdapter	It populates a DataSet and resolves updates with the data source. The base class for all DataAdapter objects is the DbDataAdapter 			class.


--> The .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server classes is located in the System.Data.SqlClient namespace.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server

--> The .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server classes is located in the System.Data.SqlClient namespace.
--> This namespace contains the following important classes.

SqlConnection	It is used to create SQL Server connection. This class cannot be inherited.
SqlCommand	It is used to execute database queries. This class cannot be inherited.
SqlDataAdapter	It represents a set of data commands and a database connection that are used to fill the DataSet. This class cannot be inherited.
SqlDataReader	It is used to read rows from a SQL Server database. This class cannot be inherited.
SqlException	This class is used to throw SQL exceptions. It throws an exception when an error is occurred. This class cannot be inherited.
