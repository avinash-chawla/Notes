1. Client Side Validation

--> There are 2 approaches that you could take to implement client side validation in asp.net core.

--> Approach 1 : Write your own custom JavaScript code to implement client-side validation which is obviously tedious and time consuming.
--> Approach 2 : Use the unobtrusive client-side validation libraries provided by asp.net core.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Library Manager

jquery.js
jquery.validate.js
jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Include them in _Layout.cshtml

<script src="~/lib/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="~/lib/jquery-validate/jquery.validate.js"></script>
<script src="~/lib/jquery-validation-unobtrusive/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js">

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. What does "Unobtrusive Validation" Mean

--> Unobtrusive Validation allows us to take the already-existing server side validation attributes and use them to implement client-side validation. 
--> We do not have to write a single line of custom JavaScript code. 
--> All we need is the above 3 script files in the order specified.

--> The unobtrusive validation is done using the jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js library. 
--> This library is built on top of jquery.validate.js library, which in turns uses jQuery. 
--> This is the reason we need to import these 3 libraries in the order specified.

5. How does client side validation work in ASP.NET Core

--> The Email property is decorated with [Required] attribute. To generate input field for Email, we use asp.net core input tag helper

<input asp-for="Email"/>

--> ASP.NET Core tag helpers work in combination with the model validation attributes and generate the following HTML. Notice in the generated HTML we have data-* attributes.

<input id="Email" name="Email" type="email" data-val="true" data-val-required="The Email field is required." />

--> The data-* attributes allow us to add extra information to an HTML element. 
--> These data-* attributes carry all the information required to perform the client-side validation. 
--> It is the unobtrusive library (i.e jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js) that reads these data-val attributes and performs the client side validation.
