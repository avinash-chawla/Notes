1. Single Layer Web Application

--> If it's a small project, you may have your presentation layer, business layer and data access layer all in one project. 
--> So if you have created a web application project using ASP.NET Core 2.1 or higher, then in that web application project, you already have Entity Framework Core installed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> In Project, expand dependencies
--> expand packages
--> expand Microsoft.AspNetCore.App

--> This package is called - metapackage. A metapackage contains list of all dependencies (other packages). 
--> In the dependencies you will find the Entity Framework Core nuget packages already installed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Multi Layer Web Application

--> In a large application we will usually have at least the following 3 layers
1. Presentation Layer
2. Business Logic Layer
3. Data Access Layer

--> These layers are implemented as separate projects. 
--> Entity Framework Core is usually required in the Data Access Layer project. 
--> The Data Access Layer project is a class library project and does not usually have the meta package referenced. 
--> So this means, Entity Framework Core is not installed for the Data Access Layer project.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. To install Entity Framework Core with SQL server database

--> you need to install the following nuget packages.

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer	
--> This nuget package contains SQL Server specific functionality

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational	
--> This nuget package contains functionality that is common to all relational databases

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore	
--> This nuget package contains common entity frameowrk core functionality



--> When we install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer package, it also installs all the other dependancies automatically.
