1. Inside CPU

--> The computer’s brain is the CPU and as we know, it is made up of the ALU and the CU. 
--> All the computation happens by using a combination of these components and the Memory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> The ALU

--> Let’s begin with the Arithmetic and Logic Unit.
--> It is the mathematical brain of the computer and a thing of beauty!
--> It is made up of 2 sections. The Arithmetic section and the Logical one.
--> Each section contains complex electrical circuits based on which Arithmetic operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide) and Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) are carried out.
--> Upon direction from the CU, the correct circuit is employed to perform the operation.

--> A and B are values which the operations are to be done on. C represents a space that is created in the memory to store the result of the operation.
--> The values A and B are sent from the Memory to the ALU along with data regarding which operation is to be performed.
--> The ALU accepts A and B, executes the instruction and saves the answer in C. This answer can now be shared with the user by using the output devices of the computer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> The Control Unit

--> Next up is the Control Unit (CU).
--> The job of the control unit is to ensure that all the components are performing the correct operations.
--> The CU reads and understands the instructions. Then it sends inputs and directions to the various other components to do the actual processing.
--> The Control Unit is the Conductor of the Orchestra!

--> Instructions can be fetched from the secondary memory or can come directly from the user. These are loaded into the memory sequentially, like the steps in the diagram.
--> From here each line of instructions is first decoded and then the execution begins.
--> Directions are given to the processing components of the computer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> Secondary Storage

--> The computer has a section called Storage to store data, programs and files.
--> When required, this information is searched for and pulled from the permanent storage. It is replicated inside the temporary storage called the RAM (Memory).
--> It is replicated inside temporary storage called the RAM (Memory).
--> From here, each sequential instruction is loaded into the CU, which then executes it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> ROM

--> There is a section of memory called the ROM. It is a permanent memory containing vital instructions. These too are loaded into the temporary memory for execution.
--> There are different types of ROM. Some are hard wired and cannot be changed like the MROM or Masked ROM. Others like The Programmable ROM (PROM), --> Erasable and Programmable ROM (EPROM) and the Electrically Erasable and Programmable ROM(EEPROM) can be modified once or multiple times.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> Registers

--> There is another type of small memory in the computer known as a register.
--> The CPU as a whole contains multiple registers in order to:
--> Fetch: Fetch Data from one component like the Memory and post it to another component like the CU.
--> Decode: Interpret instructions.
--> Execute: Executing register usually help in storing and transferring the results of operations performed by the CPU.
--> Think of registers as little helpers that run around doing small but crucial work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> A Short Summary Of Storage

--> Thus there are different things a computer needs to remember and understand in order to carry out each and every task.
--> Secondary Storage consisting of programs, data and files, usually in the form of a disk drive
--> Primary storage or volatile storage including the RAM and registers.
--> ROM made up of permanent vital instructions that need to be used from time to time.
