1. What is Java

--> Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

--> Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the Oak name to Java.

2. Application

Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.
Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
Mobile
Embedded System
Smart Card
Robotics
Games, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Types of Java Applications

--> There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:

1) Standalone Application
Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.

2) Web Application
An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.

3) Enterprise Application
An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called enterprise application. It has advantages of the high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.

4) Mobile Application
An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.

4. Java Platforms / Editions

--> There are 4 platforms or editions of Java:

1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition)
It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.

2) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)
It is an enterprise platform which is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on the top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.

3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition)
It is a micro platform which is mainly used to develop mobile applications.

4) JavaFX
It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a light-weight user interface API.

5. How Does Java Program Runs?

--> Java is a language in which we can give instructions to Computer
--> JDK has a compiler 'javac' which converts source code to java bytecode

--> JVM 
--> It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
--> JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (i.e. JVM is platform dependent).

--> JRE is an implementation of JVM
--> Consider JVM as an interface and JRE as implementation of that interface
--> Implementation provider is independent to choose the algorithm

--> JDK
--> It contains all compiler(javac), jvm, jre
