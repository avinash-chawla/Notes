1. What are ASP.NET Core Platform?

--> The ASP.NET Core platform contains the low-level features required to receive and process HTTP requests and create responses. 
--> There is an integrated HTTP server, a system of middleware components to handle requests, and core features that the application frameworks depend on, such as URL routing and the Razor view engine. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> Most of your development time will be spent with the application frameworks, but effective ASP.NET Core use requires an understanding of the powerful capabilities that the platform provides, without which the higher-level frameworks could not function. 
--> I demonstrate how the ASP.NET Core platform works in detail in Part 2 of this book and explain how the features it provides underpin every aspect of ASP.NET Core development.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> I have not described two notable platform features in this book: SignalR and gRPC. 
--> SignalR is used to create low-latency communication channels between applications. 
--> It provides the foundation for the Blazor Server framework that I describe in Part 4 of this book, but SignalR is rarely used directly, and there are better alternatives for those few projects that need low-latency messaging, such as Azure Event Grid or Azure Service Bus. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> gRPC is an emerging standard for cross-platform remote procedure calls (RPCs) over HTTP that was originally created by Google (the g in gRPC) and offers efficiency and scalability benefits. 
--> gRPC may be the future standard for web services, but it cannot be used in web applications because it requires low-level control of the HTTP messages that it sends, which browsers do not allow. (There is a browser library that allows gRPC to be used via a proxy server, but that undermines the benefits of using gRPC.) 
--> Until gRPC can be used in the browser, its inclusion in ASP.NET Core is of interest only for projects that use it for communication between back-end servers, for which many alternative protocols exist. 
--> I may cover gRPC in future editions of this book but not until it can be used in the browser or becomes the dominant data-center protocol.
