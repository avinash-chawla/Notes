1. Working with Frames-->

--> Select IPhone8 Frame

--> To duplicate
--> hold Alt + drag

--> If have any content in artboard/layer
--> drag with name

--> To align horizontally equally spaced
--> Use align options

--> Layout Grid
--> Select All
--> Columns
--> Count = 6, width=auto, Gutter=10, Type=Strtch, Margin=20, Color=ff0000, opacity=5%
--> If only one layer is selected, it is not possible to copy Layout Grid
--> Make sure all layers selected
--> To create more contrast between background and layer, change background color
--> Give each layer a different Name: Splash, home, recipe-details, recipt-details-complete, menu

-----------------------------------------------------

2. Working with Shapes-->

--> Making Splash Layer

--> Image Background
--> Select Rectangle and draw over splash layer
--> Fill: Default Red Color
--> Fill2: Image 
--> Make Image Fill downward
--> Make Red Fill Opacity 90%

--> To round corner of only one corner
--> Hold down Alt key and drag round corner dot

--> Make Chef's Hat
--> Draw Three circles side by side with some intersection
--> Make middle circle 20px up --> shift + uparrow key (2 times)
--> Align them Horizontally
--> Group them (ctrl + g)
--> Make Rectangle below them to make like chef hat
--> Align them
--> All ungroup them
--> Give some corner radius-7
--> Union Selection
--> Add only Stroke-7 (white)

--> Draw two lines below hat
--> copy and paste styles from hat
--> Make rounded corners

--> Group them

-----------------------------------------------------

--> Making Home Layer

--> Draw hamburger icon
--> Make 3 rectangle (40x6) of different width and align left
--> Make them one side rounded corner
--> This option is displayed on design panel below w and h
--> Make them group to give same fill all at a time

--> Making Search Icon
--> Make Circle with only stroke
--> Make handle to it

--> For Precise Setting
--> Select handle 
--> hold ctrl key + keyboard arrow key
--> This will inc. or dec. height and width
or
--> use only arrow key
--> this is position precisely

--> Always do this 3 things
1. Rounded corners
2. Union Selection
3. Group them

--> Draw heart icon
--> Make rectangle with 10x15
--> Make one side full rounded
--> Duplicate it
--> Rotate it by 90
--> Join them to look like heart
--> Rotate whole by 45 deg

--> To set precisely this heart
--> Place at corner
--> shift + left arrow key
--> shift + down arrow key
--> so precisely 10 pixel from boundary

--> To see the position of object
--> Select object
--> hold down alt key

--> Scaling Object
--> Always use Scale tool to scale
--> Using move tool or setting w and h by maintaining ratio won't scale rounded corners

--> Making Star
--> There are 3 options- corner radius, count, ratio (for sharp radius)
--> Duplicate them
--> In last star, we have make half filled star
--> Use Subtract selection with rectangle

-----------------------------------------------------

3. Drawing Icons-->

--> We will use Pen tool
--> Draw Shopping Bag with round handle

--> Click + drag will make curve line

--> Change only one direction of node point
--> Hold down alt key and then change

--> Paint Bucket Tool
--> It will specific section of curve
--> While normal Fill will fill whole all sections of curve

--> To give rounded corners to curve
--> Select node points holding shift and mouse click
--> From design panel, give corner radius

--> To break symmety between drag handles in pen tool
--> Hold down alt key and drag handle to preview upcoming shape
--> This happens when you draw first curve, it will symmetrical handle, so not able to preview next curve shape

--> Modifying node points and its magnitude and directions
--> Use Move tool

--> Align Node points
--> Select Node points and use align options

-----------------------------------------------------

4. Drawing Shapes using Pencil Tool-->

--> Draw Your Name Text using Pencil Tool
--> Select Move tool
--> Select bunch of node points
--> Vector menu --> Delete and heal selection

--> Devices for using Pencil tool more precisely
--> iPad Pro + Apple Pencil
--> Astropad App (https://astropad.com)

-----------------------------------------------------

5. Working with Text-->

--> AutoExpand box of Text
--> From 3 dots, choose AutoResize as Height

--> To make all Text lighter at same time
--> Edit menu --> Click on Select all with same style

-----------------------------------------------------

6. Masking Images and Shapes-->

--> Without Masking
--> Place image inside Shape directly
--> But this does not give masking options to adjust image portion inside shape

--> Masking
--> Select both image and shape
--> click on Mask in objects menu
--> Now you can scale image and adjust image

--> Another way of masking
--> Place an image directly into shape
--> In fill options, select Crop instead of normal
--> Now you can scale image and adjust image

-----------------------------------------------------

7. Importing Icons-->

--> Importing png files is not good
--> Because it is rasterize image which is in pixels not in vector

--> Open icon in adobe illustrator 
--> Drag and drop from it
--> Ungroup it

--> To change color of png
--> use Blending modes by placing color below

--> Or use svg file

-----------------------------------------------------

8. Working with Color-->

--> To change all same color at one time
--> edit menu --> Select all with same Fill
--> And then change fill

--> To choose color from image
--> use eye dropper

-----------------------------------------------------

9. Working with Styles-->

--> Blured white background
--> Draw Rectangle over Layer
--> Fill with white 
--> Effects --> Blur Background
--> Reduce the opacity of fill rectangle

--> Drop Shadow
--> It looks like windows pop up
--> Make two drop shadows
--> Blur: 4, x:0, y:4, opacity: 25%
--> Blur: 20, x:0, y:4, opacity: 10%

--> Another good way
--> Draw small rectangle for bottom shadow
--> Give Black fill and give 30% opacity
--> Under Effects, give Layer Blur and value of blur: 30 or more
--> Adjust Blending Modes

-----------------------------------------------------

10. Setting up components-->

-----------------------------------------------------

11. Using Constraints for Responsive Design-->

--> It is for Responsive Web Design

--> First Constraint is while resizing Horizontal
--> Second constraint is while resizing Vertical

--> Hamburger should be on left top corner
--> Search should be on right top corner
--> Title should be in top and Center corner

--> Frame under Frame
--> It will prevent distance changing between Texts while resizing
--> Group will not prevent

-->
