1. Difference between RGB and CMYK-->

--> Computer displays color in RGB with lightening(Luminance) thats why we see those colors bright in pc

--> Printer knows CMYK (Cyan Magenta Yellow Black) which are without extra light, it is actually seen on white paper.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

--> Select Image
--> It is RGB
--> How do you know, see in image tab
--> Image tab --> Mode --> CMYK

--> Now Luminance lost
--> It is one way street means we can not go back to RGB 

 --> When starting new document in adobe photoshop, it asks for color mode. By default, RGB is selected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Change the resolution to 300dpi-->

--> Resolution is another name for Quality

--> High Quality = High Resolution
--> Low Quality  = Low Resolution

--> Another word is DPI and PPI 
--> Pixels/inch and Dots/inch

--> Go to Image tab 

1. Image Size
2. Dimensions
3. Resolution (72 is common resolution)

4. Resample Size

--> Resolution is changing based on Requirement.

--> If it is on --> Width and height remains same, just Resolution changes
--> If it is off --> Width and height changes with Resolution
